# Prosper VS Code Theme

**Prosper** is a dark, and minimal VS Code color theme built for focus and long coding sessions.

## ✨ Overview

- Deep charcoal background with a subtle cool tone  
- Soft, balanced syntax colors — clear without being flashy  
- Muted comments and calm UI chrome for low visual noise  
- Clean contrast that keeps code readable and structured  

Prosper prioritizes clarity and visual harmony, letting your code stand out — not the theme.
